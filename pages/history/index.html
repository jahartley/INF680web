<p>Radio itself really kicked of when Italian Guglielmo Marconi managed to communicate wirelessly over the course of 2 miles during a demonstration before British officials in 1896. <a href="https://www.arrl.org/files/file/About%20ARRL/Ham_Radio_100_Years.pdf">QST Jan 2000</a> By 1901 Marconi managed to communicate across the Atlantic ocean. Its very interesting to see how far radio has come in such a short time period, and its everywhere and in everything we do today.</p>
<p>Amateur (HAM) Radio got its start in the United States with the Radio Act of 1912 which required licensing for amateur radio operators, and limited operation to the 200 meters band to reduce interference from the spark gap transmitters in use at the time. By 1915 tube receivers were in use and by the early 1920’s superheterodyne receivers, and tube amplifier transmitters, using continuous wave (CW) signals which is simply the transmission of a carrier wave at a specific frequency, using about 1% of the bandwidth of a spark gap transmitter. International morse code had been standardized in 1865 for use over telegraph lines and could now be used over wireless radio links. <a href="https://www.arrl.org/files/file/About%20ARRL/Ham_Radio_100_Years.pdf">QST Jan 2000</a></p>
<h2 id="qso" tabindex="-1">QSO</h2>
<p>By 1912, language problems between ships and shore stations led to the development of Q codes which used short three letter codes to represent common phrases or questions, starting with Q. Examples like QSO (Can you communicate with ___ direct or by relay) and QTH (What is your position) are still in use by HAM radio operators. Here is a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code#Q-codes_as_adapted_for_use_in_amateur_radio">commonly used HAM radio Q codes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-for%3F" tabindex="-1">What is it for?</h2>
<p>One of the many different ways to use HAM radio is to try and make contact with other amateur radio operators in far away places, using only the radio equipment and possibly some helping natural effects like bouncing your radio signal off the moon. While most operators use voice, it is becoming increasingly common to use digital modes to send messages and make contacts with other operators. I have personally heard other operators on 145.80 MHz FM talking with NA1SS, which is the call sign used by U.S. Astronauts in the International Space Station while scanning the 2 meter band driving up I-95 in Florida. With an amateur radio technician’s license you to can try to call <a href="https://www.ariss.org/contact-the-iss.html">the Astronauts</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contesting" tabindex="-1">Contesting</h2>
<p>In the 1920’s as amateur radio gained popularity, the American Radio Relay League <a href="https://www.arrl.org/">ARRL</a> , which began by organizing radio relays to get messages across long distances by scheduled relay stations run by amateurs, held a contest called the ARRL Transatlantic Test. This contest aimed to establish two way radio communication between amateur radio stations in North America and Europe. In the 1930’s, the ARRL standardized rules, regulations and scoring systems for contests to see how many stations a HAM could contact outside their own country. During the contest period, HAMs, following the contest rules, score points for successful two way radio communication with other stations and receive recognition and awards. Today, contesting is done with online QSO logging software and real time score reporting and online coordination among contesters. <a href="https://hamjournal.org/features-analyses/the-history-of-contesting/">Hamjournal The History of Contesting</a> This type of standardized radio contact has led to the creation of the FT8 protocol.</p>
